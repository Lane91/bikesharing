## Overview
Using Tableau we are looking to see if the citibike model in New York City could be used in Des Moines.
## Resutls
I created seven visulizations using the number of trips, usertype, gender of users and tripduration.
- There was a total of 2,344,224 trips in the month of August.
- The majority of users are male.
- There are the most users on Thursday's between 5-7pm.
- Female users tend to ride more on Saturday and Sunday.

## Summary
There is enough information to show that if the citibike model was used in Des Moines it will likely be sucessful as long as it is within high commuting areas and tourist areas. Two other visulizations could be finding the age of users, and finding out the effects of weather and how it may impact bike use.
